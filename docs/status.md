# Project Charm — Status Board

The living done/to-do board. **Read this FIRST when planning any session** (CONVENTIONS §6a),
and update it in the docs step of every session (CONVENTIONS §3). Rules:

- Edited **in place**, like design.md — this reflects *now*; journal.md holds history.
- An item leaves **Open** or **Parked** only by **shipping** or by an **explicit ruling**
  (which moves it to Closed-by-ruling) — never by fading out of memory.
- Keep it short. This is a checklist, not a third journal. One line per item, with the
  session/phase that owns the detail. The S73 migration ledger (journal S73) maps every
  pre-rebuild item to its home here.

Last updated: **Session 74** (2026-07-25; config key-name parity + Phase 71; season byte-identical).

## Current baseline

**The S72 page is the arc's recorded reference** (seed 20260720, world `stock-d1`, schedule
fingerprint `93d8c853…`): points 72.8, FG% 45.9, 3P% 36.2, FT% 70.6, PPP 1.0246, TO% 21.3,
pace 71.0, fouls 20.23/team/game (6.46 shooting / 13.77 non-shooting), usage max/p90/median
46.0% / 24.3% / 8.0%, census clean (3,470/3,470 drafted; 347/347 exact rosters; 347/347
protected coverage). Every calibration session diffs against that page, never against memory.
S73 re-proved it byte-identical after the consolidation, and **S74 again after the config-parity
work (tenth consecutive sandbox↔Windows season match)**. Engine state: all Rolls A–M real; the world
drafts the Pass-3 two-plane budget cohort (S70 bridge); `PressureVolumeTaxScale` 0.30 is the one
calibrated dial (S72); Pass 2 is retired and archived (S73); **the settings file and the config classes
are name-parity-locked by Phase 71 (S74)** — `config.json` SHA-256 `5094367e…`.

**Note on comparing runs:** only the **season** page is byte-comparable between Claude's sandbox and
Emmett's machine. The suite/observation page is not — the sandbox runs under invariant culture and
prints `49.8 %` where Windows prints `49.8%` (S74 finding). Do not hash suite output as an acceptance
artifact.

## Red blockers — resolve before major new work

- **R-1 — Rotation has no consequences: starters take 87.9% of possessions, 279 players
  never play, and no foul-out logic exists anywhere (S72 Phase-M finding; S73 corrected
  wording).** The fatigue-fence substitution policy IS wired into the season runner
  (`RunSingleGenGame` passes it; S73 source-verified) but is nearly inert in outcome. This
  blocks every calibration item that prices effort or load — the S72 tax value, relief
  tuning, Pass A page-tuning — because they were all measured in a five-man world with no
  fatigue or foul cost. Rotation/foul-outs are their own session (S75+ per the S73 prompt).

## Open — next-session candidates

- **O-1 — Intent-vs-touches ruling (S60).** The usage curve pays on the offense's intended
  share, pre-tilt/pre-denial; the denied big earns nothing. Rule this before touching the
  relief scale, or the scale absorbs the error.
- **O-2 — Relief-scale tuning (S60, quantified S60.2 as ~10× too quiet).** Behind O-1 and R-1.
- **O-3 — Usage architecture: the rail authors every star, HierarchyRank is mostly dead,
  and nothing takes the ball from a cold shooter (S59.2 + S60.2).** Both channels inside
  8–40% by design; the rail back to an emergency brake; volume pricing is the tax's job.
  Live evidence: usage max 46.0% on the real world.
- **O-4 — ★ The tax↔defensive-settings coupled pair (S72 ruling, MANDATORY revisit).**
  Attention multiplies the tax; when the defensive-settings layer lands, 0.30 gets re-walked.
- **O-5 — Residual channel is dead on the real population (S72 observation).** Mean ~0.0002;
  understand-or-retire, not a dial session.
- **O-6 — Scout-rank modernization (S63, re-based S70).** Three old-pool assumptions on the
  record: big-ATH +8 add-back, position-relative SIZE tails / guard-leaning board, stretch-big
  Outside invisible to SKILL. One ruled session.
- **O-7 — Drive gate Pass B: post-feed + usage diffusion (S59).** The "he gave it up" outcome —
  a denied drive currently always becomes his own contested jumper, never someone else's shot.
- **O-8 — Drive gate Pass C: the off-ball open-three lever (S59).**
- **O-9 — Pass A page-tuning, first item the level-neutrality finding (gate not neutral below
  rating ~48, a property of the locked spec) (S59).** Calibration — behind R-1.
- **O-10 — Re-measure the eight attribute families vs DIALED opponents / point something
  through `opponentDials` (S59.2 + S60.2).** Every S45–S55.1 finding carries the flat-50
  caveat; the instrument is built and still unused by any committed sweep.
- **O-11 — The random-vs-elite scoring spread is unexplained (S60.2).** 12-point PPG spread
  vs a nearly flat divisional ladder; do not assume benign.
- **O-12 — HelpDefense overhelp / rotation cost (recovered S60).** Feeds the
  rotation/defensive-settings design work.
- **O-13 — BasketballIQ's dead lower half — should low IQ actively hurt? (recovered S60).**
- **O-14 — DefenderPicker promotion / on-ball mismatch hunting (recovered S60).** Becomes
  real when the pick turns mismatch-hunting; this is the second door's second door.
- **O-15 — Remaining calibration queue (behind R-1): TO% 21.3 vs ~18.5 target; turnover-band
  placeholders (S37); the assist lever (10.1 vs ~13.5, S49); curve-steepness conversation;
  displacement magnitude (oracle-first only); the S48 FT-90 micro-flag.**
- **O-16 — The light block channel (S50 design question 2).** Magnitude call on a real
  population.
- **O-17 — Weight: feed Strength-adjacent channels or wait for a body-contact layer?
  (S50 design question 4; proven cosmetic today).**
- **O-18 — SelfCreation perimeter assist discount (S57 residue).** S57 did interior only.
- **O-19 — Refresh `docs/attribute-wiring-synthesis.md` when the attribute map moves (S60).**
- **O-20 — `game` demo: upgrade to real generators or retire (labeled as stub-driven on its
  banner at S73).** Micro-session, or rides any session touching Program.Game.cs.
- **O-21 — Normalize the three config loader shapes (S74 deferral).** Eighteen sections are sectioned
  `Deserialize`; `RollAConfig` is root-flat; `RollEConfig` is nineteen hand-written `GetProperty`
  assignments. The divergence is declared and asserted by Phase 71's registry, not hidden — but folding
  RollA/RollE into the common shape is its own session with its own drift audit. Not urgent: RollE's
  binding is now behaviourally proven.

## Parked — waiting on a named prerequisite

- **P-1 — Shooting-foul positional lean (~50.7/49.3) → the help-defense/rotation model (S62).**
- **P-2 — Steals' pressure-DIAL side → the coaching/pressure layer (S52, updated S58).**
- **P-3 — BallHandling's pressure-dialed test → the coaching layer (S49).**
- **P-4 — OT-LOW (~2.8% vs 6% target) → the coaching / late-game-strategy layer (post-S41).**
- **P-5 — Endurance's temporal shape → a time-sliced bench (S50).**
- **P-6 — Wingspan's jump-ball tip → a first-possession counter (S50).**
- **P-7 — PostDefense-as-size coupling → the synthesis pass (S52).**
- **P-8 — Age/class population structure → the season/recruiting layer (S42.1 ruling).**
- **P-9 — Roll G lineup-context bend (teammate spacing/gravity as selection) → its own
  design conversation; the attributes are carried on Player, unread.**
- **P-10 — Shooting-foul rate dial (bridge #3) → no longer urgent post-S40; a page question.**
- **P-11 — Reconciled team-rebound line → instrument work (S41; credited gap ~4.9/team/game
  is a definition gap, not a sim error).**
- **P-12 — The full personal-turnover attribution flip → the per-event attribution rework
  (S56 flattened the inversion; the committer-picker channel still climbs with usage).**
- **P-13 — Small parked tail (owner sessions in parentheses):** `Outside == 0` buzzer heave
  (S35); personality/timidity on usage (S36); per-player attribution for held balls / Roll K
  (S33); press-frequency sentinels; length-in-make% defender term (S17/S40-era); per-zone
  location-blend weights + corner-three split (P9); reference-card pinning + multi-seed
  (S31/32); EqualShare centralization (P28); opening-five/lineup logic; FT unattributed
  bonus-trip fallback (~0 volume on populated rosters); displacement "advantaged" bin (S36);
  code hygiene (WeightedAggregate duplication, Mk consolidation, RollE stub double-build).
- **P-14 — Long-term watches (design before the relevant layer ships, not now):** save-file
  schema versioning; end-to-end RNG/determinism review before the full season layer; the
  Player data layer at 21k+ actives; moddability. (working-with-emmett §7)

## Closed by ruling (looks unfinished — is not; do not "fix")

- **C-1 — Defensive ratings are the MAN-TO-MAN wire; a future scheme layer TOGGLES distinct
  wiring sets (S61 architecture ruling).**
- **C-2 — Team-aggression fouls belong to the coach/pressure layer, not Hustle (S61; the
  S45 Hustle→foul coupling retired S62, its dead dials deleted S73).**
- **C-3 — The ball-dominance / initiation layer is NOT built; assists attach after the
  fact, accepted as ornamental for now (S57.1).**
- **C-4 — Turnover KIND stays flat; attributes drive how often, not which flavor.**
- **C-5 — Roll D foul flavor stays flat (fires before Roll G — no zone stamped).**
- **C-6 — Offensive-foul flavor stays flat beyond the frontcourt/backcourt split.**
- **C-7 — The and-1 split (MafFraction) is per-zone, not matchup-aware.**
- **C-8 — Tendencies are deterministic in ratings; same ratings, same diet.**
- **C-9 — Held-ball losses stay off the turnover line (S33 R1).**
- **C-10 — The tendency oracle's population-mean diet is a directional diagnostic only.**
- **C-11 — DisplacementMaxMagnitude = 0 is ablation only; it does not undo Route B.**
- **C-12 — Turnover clock is court-aware bands, not a shifted center (S37); an
  offensive-rebounded possession times as a frontcourt turnover.**
- **C-13 — The fast break sets a modern base diet bent per shooter (S38); Roll K putbacks
  are excluded from fast-break FGA accounting (S38).**
- **C-14 — Three-point VOLUME is a generation/era-profile lever, not a runtime knob (S39).**
- **C-15 — Shooting fouls count toward the team-foul total (S40).**
- **C-16 — The halfcourt turnover mix is 50/50 live/dead, "to start" (S41).**
- **C-17 — The assist lineup-passing midpoint tracks the generated population (S41).**
- **C-18 — The 55/45 rebound team split stays; the picker was the culprit and was fixed
  (S45 ruling, S46 fix).**
- **C-19 — Rebounder-picker body attribution keeps the S46 shape (Emmett's rulings).**
- **C-20 — The recruiting line is first-past-the-line at R_LINE 17, "all of college";
  top-of-class selection is the divisional layer's job (S66, explicitly reversible).**
- **C-21 — Position follows the defensive plane, exact-count 40/30/30; height gets no
  vote; offensive role rides as flavor (S70).**
- **C-22 — The generated rebounding scale keeps, explicitly reversible (S70).**
- **C-23 — Divisional sorting: size/athleticism are the unofficial gates between divisions;
  skill overlaps heavily and is premium-overridable (Emmett ruling 2026-07-12).**
- **C-24 — Pass 2 (skill-first generator) is RETIRED and archived (S73); its oracle rulings
  (S42/S42.1) are historical record under `tools/archive/pass2/` and journal S42–S44.**
- **C-25 — A missing config key stays QUIET AT RUNTIME (compiled default applies, the game boots)
  and becomes LOUD AT TEST TIME via Phase 71 (Emmett ruling 2026-07-25).** Refuse-to-boot was
  considered and rejected: it would force every future dial into two places forever.

## Next approved candidate — exactly ONE

- **S75 — rotation and foul-outs (clears Red blocker R-1).** Starters take 87.9% of possessions,
  279 players never play, and no foul-out logic exists anywhere. Every calibration item behind R-1
  (the S72 tax value, relief tuning, Pass A page-tuning) was measured in a five-man world with no
  fatigue or foul cost, so this unblocks the calibration arc rather than adding to it.

*(S74 shipped — config key-name parity + Phase 71; historical detail in journal S74. Note the
"strict loader" framing it was originally given is retired: Emmett ruled quiet-at-runtime /
loud-at-test (C-25), and the scope narrowed to key-name parity plus RollE binding. The board's
motivating premise was also measurably wrong — zero orphan keys existed; the real gap ran the other
way, twelve properties with no key.)*
